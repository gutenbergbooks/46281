  <p>At the time (1864) when this Monograph was commenced, the successful application of the system
  of cool treatment to Orchids accustomed to a moderate temperature in their native haunts gave a
  fresh impulse to the cultivation of that charming tribe of plants. By its means, what might almost
  be regarded as a new Orchid-world, teeming with interest and beauty, was suddenly brought within
  our reach. A fresh field was opened to the enterprise of collectors, the spirits of cultivators
  revived, and the hopes of botanists mounted high. Foremost among the spoils that we sought to
  secure, stood the various members of the genus <span class="sc">Odontoglossum</span>, which from
  the days of Humboldt<a id="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and Lexarza, was known to abound
  in species pre-eminent for the loveliness and delicacy of their flowers but which had hitherto
  mocked the utmost efforts of our most skilful growers. For although (thanks to the labours of
  Warczewitz and Lobb) the Horticultural Society and Messrs. Veitch had more than once received
  large consignments of Orchids&mdash;among which were many <i>Odontoglossa</i>&mdash;from the
  mountain ranges of New Grenada and Peru, they had invariably succumbed under the stifling
  atmosphere to which, in common with the denizens of India, Guiana, or Madagascar, they were
  remorselessly consigned. Here and there, indeed, an accidental success was achieved in a
  greenhouse, but the hint was turned to no account, and as a rule&mdash;notwithstanding the
  repeated warnings and remonstrances of Mr. Skinner, Warczewitz, and others&mdash;for thirty years
  we persisted in the incredible folly of growing "cool" Orchids in "hot" stoves; so deeply rooted
  in the minds of horticulturists was the original prejudice! But it yielded at last, and no sooner
  had a few houses&mdash;constructed and managed on the cool-culture system&mdash;made it clear that
  the Orchids of temperate regions were prepared to submit to the skill of the cultivator, than a
  general raid was made upon the more accessible countries in which they were known to
  abound&mdash;more especially certain districts in Mexico and New Grenada. To the latter country,
  collectors were simultaneously sent off by the Horticultural Society, who despatched Mr. Weir; by
  Mr. Linden, of Brussels; and by Messrs. Low, of the Clapton Nursery; and all these rival envoys,
  much to their own mortification and chagrin, found themselves sailing for the same destination in
  the same steamer on the same errand!</p>

  <p>It was now that the idea occurred to me of devoting a work of adequate dimensions to the
  illustration of the particular genus, which from the dried specimens in our herbaria, the plates
  in <i>Pescatorea</i>, the figures of Humboldt, and the descriptions of travellers was evidently
  destined to hold the first place among all the numerous company of cool Orchids; and thus began
  the present Monograph. I had expected that after the work of importation had fairly commenced, not
  only would the species described by Lindley and Reichenbach be easily obtained, but that along
  with these a multitude of others entirely new to science would likewise be received. In this
  respect, however, the results have scarcely come up to expectations; a circumstance that is partly
  to be accounted for by the difficulty attendant on their importation,<a id="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> but which is owing, I grieve to say, in a far greater degree to
  the untimely deaths of those zealous collectors, Bowman and Pearse, who, when in the very heart of
  the cool Orchid regions of Ecuador and Peru, succumbed under the pressure of their arduous
  labours. In Mexico, from which much novelty was expected, little has been added to the number of
  <i>Odontoglossa</i> previously known, and the same may be said of Costa Rica, notwithstanding the
  vigorous exertions of Mr. Endries. But in these countries it is evident that the genus is not so
  fully developed as in the mountain ranges of New Grenada, Quito, and Peru. From the latter country
  little indeed has yet been received, although the eastern slopes of its Andean chain are probably
  richer in species of unknown or unimported Orchids than any other portion of the globe. But we
  must await further improvements in the navigation of the affluents of the mighty Amazon, before we
  can hope to receive any large instalment of these much-coveted treasures.</p>

  <p>A combination of the various causes referred to above, by limiting the choice of materials, has
  seriously delayed the publication of this work, which I had hoped would by this time have reckoned
  at least a dozen parts. But as there seems to be no immediate prospect of these hindrances to more
  rapid progress being taken out of the way, and as the sands of my life are fast running out, I
  have thought it best in the interests of my subscribers, to make the present number the last. The
  six parts now published will, however, form a volume of convenient size, and one which may, as I
  trust, serve to show how rich New Grenada is in the members of this glorious genus. What wealth of
  <i>Odontoglossa</i> Peru may possess, I must leave some future botanist to unfold. He will have a
  pleasant task, and will probably have doubled the roll of the genus as now known, before his work
  is done.</p>

  <p>During the progress of this Monograph a curious incident has occurred, which may deserve a
  brief notice. When the publication was commenced, the introduction of two particular
  plants&mdash;more perhaps than of any others known to orchidists&mdash;was earnestly desired by
  growers, these two being the <i>Odontoglossum crispum</i> of Lindley, and the <i>Cuitlauzina
  pendula</i> of Lexarza. The finding, or rather the re-finding of the former&mdash;so magnificent
  were the specimens in the Lindleyan Herbarium&mdash;was declared to be worth a king's ransom;
  while for the latter&mdash;described as a native of Oaxaca&mdash;more than one collector had
  scoured that province in vain. <i>Strange to say, they were already in our grasp</i>: the <i>O.
  crispum</i> being none other than my <i>O. Alexandræ</i>, while&mdash;as explained under Plate
  VIII.&mdash;the <i>Cuitlauzina</i> proves to be identical with the long previously introduced
  <i>Odontoglossum citrosmum</i> of Lindley. Whether all the botanical pressure that can be brought
  to bear upon our cultivators may suffice to convert <i>O. Alexandræ</i> into <i>O. crispum</i>, or
  change <i>O. citrosmum</i> into <i>O. pendulum</i>, is an extremely doubtful question, so strong
  is the hold that the erroneous names have already secured on the public mind. In the parallel case
  of <i>Wellingtonia</i>, that popular Conifer&mdash;though now almost universally admitted to be a
  <i>Sequoia</i>&mdash;remains <i>Wellingtonia</i> still, and seems likely to do so for all time to
  come.</p>

  <p>The range of the genus <i>Odontoglossum</i>, as may be gathered from the descriptions attached
  to the various Plates, is of a peculiar character, being at once restricted and extensive. It is
  restricted, for it never leaves the Andes, and it is extensive, for it is found in all parts of
  that vast mountain-chain, from the confines of Florida to the frontiers of Chili. As yet no
  species has ever been met with at a lower elevation than 2500 feet above the sea-level, nor, with
  the exception of <i>O. hastilabium</i>, has any <i>Odontoglossum</i> been known to descend so
  low;&mdash;the most usual altitude being 5-6000 feet, though a higher point is often reached. Like
  the humming-birds which frequent the same mountains, and vie with them in beauty, nearly all the
  <i>Odontoglossa</i> are exceedingly local, and in this way two of the most beautiful species,
  <i>e.g.</i>, <i>O. vexillarium</i> and <i>O. Roezlii</i>, eluded discovery for many years, even in
  a region supposed to be well explored by collectors.</p>

  <p>As to the botanical limits of the genus, I must needs confess that they are exceedingly
  difficult to fix. It is as true now as when Professor Lindley first made the observation to me,
  that "The more we build up the partition walls between <i>Odontoglossum</i>, <i>Oncidium</i>,
  &amp;c., the more the species break them down." Certainly no one at first sight would suppose
  <i>Odontoglossum cariniferum</i> was anything but an <i>Oncidium</i>, nor <i>Oncidium
  macranthum</i> other than an <i>Odontoglossum</i>. Indeed, I must own to a suspicion that
  ultimately both these genera, together with <i>Miltonia</i>, <i>Mesospinidium</i>, <i>Aspasia</i>,
  and possibly one or two others, may come to be regarded merely as <i>sub</i>-genera, But this
  difficult question is safest left in Professor Reichenbach's far abler hands. At the same time, it
  is not to be denied that there is such a peculiar look about the <i>Odontoglossa</i>, that even a
  non-scientific observer has seldom any difficulty in at once referring most of the species to
  their true position.</p>

  <p>One other matter remains to which I must very briefly advert. Mr. Darwin's fascinating work on
  the "Fertilization" of Orchids has led many persons to suppose that this beautiful tribe lends an
  exceptional amount of support to the theory with which that ingenious writer's name is so
  prominently associated, but there could scarcely be a greater mistake. Not only is the theory in
  question utterly rejected by Professor Reichenbach, the <i>facile princeps</i> of living
  orchidists, but the greater our knowledge of the order, the less countenance does it seem to yield
  to the Darwinian view. We have now become perfectly well acquainted with all the genera&mdash;we
  might almost say with all the species&mdash;that belong to particular countries, but it is in
  these that the limits of variation between the different forms are most distinctly defined; in
  these, too, the great principle of unity in diversity is most conspicuous&mdash;the genera holding
  aloof from each other, and even the species keeping themselves distinct, although the Orchid mark
  is unmistakeably stamped upon all alike. Mr. Gould has remarked, in his great work on the
  "<i>Trochilidæ</i>," that the Darwinian theory derives no support from <i>them</i>, and the same
  may be safely affirmed of Orchids, which&mdash;we are now speaking of America&mdash;are the
  humming-birds' constant associates. Neither, while we contemplate the marvellous and inexhaustible
  variety of form by which the order is distinguished above all its fellows, can any plead that this
  result is due to its ancient lineage, nor yet to the vast periods through which endless
  transformations are assumed to have been continually taking place, because Orchids&mdash;according
  to geologic reckoning&mdash;are but a thing of yesterday, and have never been found in a fossil
  state. Yet their constant companions the Ferns, trace back their pedigree to the earliest
  vegetation of the primeval world! To the believer, however, the problem is not hard to solve.
  Ferns and other flowerless plants came early in the Divine programme, because the coal, into which
  they were to be ultimately converted, had need to be long accumulating for the future comfort and
  civilization of our race; while the genesis of Orchids was postponed until the time drew near when
  Man, who was to be soothed by the gentle influence of their beauty, or charmed by the marvellous
  variety of their structure, was about to appear upon the scene. There are multitudes who could
  bear witness how amply, in their own experience, this gracious purpose has been fulfilled; while
  the writer&mdash;in whose breast a love of Orchids prevailed from his youth up&mdash;can only
  exclaim with the Psalmist, "Thou, Oh Lord, hast made me glad through Thy works, and I will rejoice
  in giving thanks for the operation of Thy hand."</p>

  <p>It was at Munich, in the year 1835, that I first became acquainted with this fine
  <i>Odontoglossum</i> having, through the kindness of Professor Von Martius, been allowed to
  examine the rich collection of dried specimens that Baron Karwinski had then recently brought home
  with him from Mexico. Two years afterwards living plants were sent to me from Oaxaca, which
  happening to arrive in the midst of that remarkably severe winter 1837-38, I naturally expected
  would have been destroyed on their way; so far, however, from this being the case, they appeared
  to have sustained little or no injury from the cold, and on being placed in a stove they soon
  began to push both roots and leaves. All went well so long as the temperature of the house did not
  exceed 70°, but when the winter had passed away and they had to face the intense heat at which the
  Orchid-houses of that period were ordinarily maintained, they then quickly lost their vigour and
  before a twelvemonth had passed were all gone, victims&mdash;like a multitude of other invaluable
  plants&mdash;to our then ignorance of the conditions under which alone the Orchids of <i>cool</i>
  countries could be expected to thrive!</p>

  <p>I am not aware that this plant ever flowered in this country until within the last year or two,
  certainly no figure of it has ever been published in any English botanical periodical; I have,
  however, found in a French work (the <i>Illustration Horticole</i>), under the name of <i>O.
  maxillare</i>, what is obviously the same as the plant represented in the Plate. I should myself
  have probably fallen into the same mistake as Professor Lemaire, had I not enjoyed the
  opportunity&mdash;which he unfortunately had not&mdash;of examining the original specimens in Dr.
  Lindley's herbarium, and from which that able botanist drew up his description (in the <i>Folia
  Orchidacea</i>) of the two species. <i>O. maxillare</i>, of which Dr. Lindley only examined a
  single flower&mdash;though he made a most careful drawing&mdash;is shown by a glance at the
  latter, to be a totally different thing; it has moreover, I fear, long since disappeared from our
  collections. In Dr. Lindley's description the flower-scape is said to be terminal, which in nature
  it never is, although from the way in which Karwinski's wild specimen was glued together, it
  certainly presents that appearance in the herbarium. The column moreover, and the base of the
  sepals and petals, are said to be pubescent, though nothing of the kind is visible to the naked
  eye when the flowers are fresh. With a powerful magnifying glass pubescence may certainly be
  seen.</p>

  <p><i>Odontoglossum nebulosum</i> flowers at different seasons of the year, always sending up its
  scape at the same time as the young growth. It is of the easiest culture.<a id="NtA_3"
  href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> The figure was derived from a beautiful specimen that flowered
  last November in the collection of J. Day, Esq., of Tottenham, who grows this and many other
  <i>Odontoglossa</i> in high perfection.</p>

  <p>This is a robust and stately plant, nearly allied to <i>O. Bictoniense</i> to which at one time
  Dr. Lindley was disposed to refer it, but far larger and handsomer in all its parts. Its broad
  pseudobulbs which become covered in their second year with a multitude of small reddish dots, its
  wide sepals and petals, the spotting of its lip, and its general resemblance to <i>Zygopetalum
  Mackaii</i> will, however, sufficiently distinguish it. Being found at a higher elevation than
  <i>O. Bictoniense</i>, it requires to be kept more cool, and as it affects dark and wet banks in
  its native wilds, it is better to place it in a north house where it can be more readily protected
  from the sun. Treated in this way it grows luxuriantly and flowers abundantly at Knypersley,
  whence the specimen figured in the Plate was derived. Its flowering season seems to vary, for
  while with me it is now (May) coming into bloom, about London November is the more usual
  month.</p>

  <p><i>O. Uro-Skinneri</i> was the latest discovery of my indefatigable friend Mr. Skinner (after
  whom it was named by Dr. Lindley), and who, though now settled in England, is as much devoted to
  his favourite tribe as when, while resident in Guatemala, he was wont to delight the Orchidists of
  Europe by the multitude of new and beautiful plants that he was constantly dispatching across the
  main.</p>

  <p>This most charming <i>Odontoglossum</i> was discovered in the year 1850 by M. Schlim at that
  time engaged in exploring the higher regions of New Granada in the service of M. Linden to whose
  well-known horticultural establishment at Brussels he had the honour of introducing it. The
  species was seen in flower for the first time in the year 1856 when it appeared at some
  Horticultural Exhibitions both on the Continent and in London and, as may readily be conceived,
  attracted universal admiration. Since that time its lovely blossoms have been rarely produced,
  owing no doubt to its cultivation having been imperfectly understood. It has however, I believe,
  bloomed occasionally in the collection of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and more recently in
  that of E. M&lsquo;Morland, Esq., of Haverstock Hill, with whom it thrives amazingly, and to whose
  kindness I am indebted for the opportunity of figuring it. In its native country it is found in a
  mild climate growing on the ground, or upon rocks in moist and shady situations, and by simply
  imitating these conditions Mr. M&lsquo;Morland cultivates it with the most perfect success. His
  plants are kept in pots, with living moss on the surface, and their base resting in pans of water
  the evaporation from which cannot fail to be highly beneficial. The temperature of the house in
  which they are grown is that of an ordinary greenhouse, but the air is always humid, and water is
  freely given because, in consequence of the <i>open potting</i>, it can pass as freely away. The
  plants seem to grow and flower almost all the year round, though their proper and principal
  flowering-season is in May and June.</p>

  <p><i>O. phalænopsis</i> is entirely distinct from any species of the genus yet in cultivation,
  but it is allied to a still finer plant detected by Warszewicz in Costa Rica, and called in honour
  of its discoverer <i>O. Warszewiczii</i> by Professor Reichenbach.</p>

  <p>This <i>Odontoglossum</i> was originally introduced from Mexico by the late Mr. Barker, of
  Birmingham, after whose gardener it was named by Dr. Lindley. It flowered with Mr. Barker
  somewhere about the year 1840, when a figure was prepared for the 'Orchidaceæ of Mexico and
  Guatemala,' but I had not then the opportunity of examining the plant, nor indeed did I ever
  actually see it in flower until the autumn of last year (1863) when I happened to meet with the
  specimen from which the illustration is derived, growing and blooming vigorously in the collection
  of Dr. Cauty, of Liverpool. The species had, in fact, virtually disappeared from collections
  during an interregnum of twenty years, and its reappearance is entirely due to the adoption of the
  rational system of cool treatment now happily prevailing, and under which it may be cultivated
  with the greatest ease.</p>

  <p>In habit <i>O. Insleayi</i> is quite indistinguishable from <i>O. grande</i>; and although its
  flowers are far inferior in beauty to those of that glorious species, they bear a certain sort of
  resemblance to them in their colouring and general arrangement. The structure is however entirely
  different, for while <i>O. grande</i> has no bristle-like appendages to its column, and therefore
  belongs to the section of the genus which has been called <span class="sc">Xanthoglossum</span> by
  Dr. Lindley, the processes in question are clearly present (see Dissections) in the case of <i>O.
  Insleayi</i>, thereby bringing it under the preceding section, to which the title of <span
  class="sc">Euodontoglossum</span> has been given by the same authority. The time and mode of
  flowering are also different in the two plants, for while in <i>O. grande</i> the flower-scapes
  appear almost simultaneously with the leaves, and are usually in perfection in July, those of
  <i>O. Insleayi</i> are not produced until long after the pseudobulbs have been matured, nor do
  they expand their blossoms until late in the autumn.</p>

  <p>As is the case with most of its congeners, there are many varieties of <i>O. Insleayi</i>, some
  of which are much less attractive in their colouring than the one represented in the Plate, while
  others have much larger flowers, as in the example given in the vignette which is copied from an
  old woodcut in the Journal of the Horticultural Society. Unfortunately this latter variety has, I
  greatly fear, been lost to the country, but collectors should endeavour to reintroduce it.</p>

  <p>I have already referred to Dr. Cauty's success in the treatment of the subject of the present
  Plate, but his skill and care are equally conspicuous in the management of a miscellaneous
  collection of Orchids, which he contrives to grow under circumstances such as would have deterred
  most men from attempting to grow any plants at all. The house in which he lives is in the very
  centre of Liverpool, and has in its rear a small back court, such as is usually devoted to
  dustbins and coal-holes, but where Dr. Cauty has found space for three little Orchid-houses of
  different temperatures in which the Orchids of different climes are perfectly at home. I can
  really see no reason why in all large towns&mdash;in London more especially&mdash;Dr. Cauty's
  example should not be extensively followed, and the luxury of an Orchid-house be thus brought
  within the reach of many who now consider it quite beyond their grasp.</p>

  <p>This lovely plant was discovered in the year 1847 by MM. Funck and Schlim when on a botanical
  mission to New Granada, in the service of M. Linden. According to its discoverers, it is not
  unfrequently met with in the provinces of Pamplona and Ocaña, at an elevation above the sea-level
  of about 5000 feet, inhabiting the oak forests which&mdash;where the climate is mild&mdash;clothe
  the eastern slopes of the glorious Cordillera.</p>

  <p><i>O. Pescatorei</i> flowered with M. Linden for the first time in 1851, and attracted, as well
  it might, universal admiration. Nothing indeed, even in the beautiful family to which it belongs,
  can surpass the delicacy of its blossoms, with their charming mixture of rose and white, relieved
  by a few deep-crimson stains scattered irregularly over the lip. Its habit too is good, and its
  stately panicle of flowers well-proportioned to the size of the bulbs and leaves. It blooms
  abundantly in the spring months, and its blossoms continue at least six weeks in perfection. We
  need not wonder that a plant with such a rare combination of good qualities should have been
  selected by M. Linden to do honour to his patron the late M. Pescatore, after whom he named it,
  and in whose sumptuous work ('Pescatorea') it forms the first plate.</p>

  <p>Although the species, owing to the difficulty of importing it alive, is still exceedingly rare
  in this country, it has already flowered in many of the principal collections, especially in those
  of Mr. Rucker, Mr. Basset, Mr. Day, and Mr. Dawson, of Meadow Bank near Edinburgh. With the
  last-named gentleman a panicle, with sixty flowers upon it, is now (April, 1864) in full beauty.
  Mr. Fitch's drawing was taken from an exquisite variety, of which Mr. Day is the fortunate
  possessor, and which he kindly placed at my disposal for the purpose of being figured in this
  Work. In the Plate the flower-spike is represented as panicled because such&mdash;as in the case
  of all the other varieties&mdash;is no doubt its normal state; as yet however racemes only have
  been produced.</p>

  <p>The treatment recommended for other <i>Odontoglossa</i> (see under Plate I.) will suit <i>O.
  Pescatorei</i>, which is as easily managed as any of the genus.</p>

  <p>Early in the present century, two Spaniards&mdash;La Llave and Lexarza by name&mdash;settled at
  the Mexican town of Valladolid, in the fertile province of Mechoacan. They were both attached to
  botany, but the younger of the two, Lexarza, was so attracted by the beauty of the numerous
  Orchids of the district that to these he devoted himself with an ardour that would have done
  honour even to the Lindleys and Reichenbachs of our own day. As the result of his labours a little
  work&mdash;'Orchidianum Opusculum' he modestly styled it&mdash;presently made its appearance,
  wherein about fifty species, all at that time new to science, were described with remarkable
  accuracy and skill. Among the number there was a plant,&mdash;<i>Cuitlauzina pendula</i> he called
  it,&mdash;said to be of surpassing loveliness and to form an undoubtedly new genus the distinctive
  characters of which were minutely given. As time went on and the rage for Orchids developed itself
  in Europe, a keen desire was naturally felt by cultivators to add so fine a plant to their lists;
  but although many collectors visited Valladolid and laid hands upon nearly all the other desirable
  Orchids described by Lexarza, still nothing was heard of the <i>Cuitlauzina</i>, and on the cover
  of the latest number of Dr. Lindley's 'Folia Orchidacea' its name may be found in the list of
  genera "unknown to the author." About the same time I myself addressed a letter to the 'Gardeners'
  Chronicle' urging some adventurous traveller to take ship for New Spain, mainly with the object of
  instituting another search for the tantalizing plant that had hitherto eluded our grasp. Yet all
  this while <i>Cuitlauzina pendula</i> was amongst us, and indeed had been an established favourite
  for upwards of twenty years! But if so, it may well be asked, how came it to pass that it was
  never recognized? For a full reply to this very natural inquiry I must refer the reader to a most
  ingenious article in 'Bonplandia' (Jahrg. iii. No. 15, 16), by the younger Reichenbach, to whom
  all the credit is due of having solved a great botanical puzzle, and proved to demonstration that
  the <i>Cuitlauzina pendula</i> of Lexarza is none other than the <i>Odontoglossum citrosmum</i> of
  Lindley.<a id="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Under these circumstances, however undesirable the meddling with established names, I scarcely
  see how, in common justice to Lexarza, we can do otherwise than adopt his specific name of
  <i>pendula</i>, more especially as it happens that the plant to which he originally gave it
  remains to this day the only one out of nearly a hundred <i>Odontoglossa</i> that has flower-stems
  which are strictly <i>pendulous</i>.</p>

  <p>Our gardens contain many varieties of <i>O. pendulum</i>, of which, though all are beautiful,
  some are far superior to others. That represented in the Plate, and which forms a part of Mr.
  Rucker's collection, is among the best. Mr. Rucker keeps it in his coolest house, where it is
  perfectly at home, and produces a profusion of its lovely drooping racemes in May and June. It
  should always be grown in a pot.</p>

  <p>As this stately <i>Odontoglossum</i> is met with at a much lower elevation than any of its
  congeners, it is constitutionally less impatient of heat, and has therefore been able to
  accommodate itself to artificial conditions under which others of its race in former years have
  pined and died. But although in some parts of New Granada it descends as low as 2500 feet, its
  more frequent range is 2000 feet higher up the mountains, and it is in such situations that it
  attains its greatest luxuriance and beauty. Some imported specimens that I was fortunate enough to
  see last year (1864) at the Clapton Nursery, whither they had been sent by Mr. Blunt, had
  flower-stems half an inch thick and fully 6 feet high. These were gathered at an elevation of at
  least 4000 feet above the sea-level and, as they arrived in excellent condition and have been
  extensively distributed, I have little doubt we shall ere long see cultivated specimens that may
  vie with the wild ones in stature and magnificence. Its flowering season is the spring or early
  summer.</p>

  <p>The figure was taken in May last from a plant in Mr. Rucker's collection where it is grown at
  the coolest end of the Cattleya-house.</p>

  <p>Mr. Skinner was the fortunate discoverer of this noble <i>Odontoglossum</i> which to this day
  remains unsurpassed, even among all the fine additions that have of late years been made to the
  genus. Mr. Skinner found it in a "barranca" (or dark ravine) in the environs of the city of
  Guatemala, and so closely had it lain concealed that even his quick eye failed to detect it until
  long after he had, as he thought, exhausted the district of all its finest Orchids. It was
  afterwards met with in other localities, but invariably in a climate of which the ordinary range
  of temperature lay between 60° and 70°, and in situations where it was secure of abundant moisture
  and constant shade. In these peculiarities of its natural habitat the conditions of its successful
  cultivation are clearly pointed out; yet, strange to say, they were unheeded for twenty years,
  during which the plants in our Orchid-houses were always in a feeble and sickly state, rarely
  producing more than two or three flowers on a scape, while the imported specimens showed that at
  least double that number was the proper quota. Now, however, the case is different, for with a
  mild temperature and moderate shade they are found to be managed with the most perfect ease and to
  grow with a vigour that could never have been exceeded in their native wilds. In proof of this we
  need only turn to the vignette, which is copied from a beautiful photograph kindly sent to me by
  Joshua Saunders, Esq., and which represents a specimen of <i>O. grande</i> as it appeared when
  flowering in his collection at Clifton. As a further evidence of the ease with which the plant may
  be grown I may mention that under the care of Major Trevor Clarke it has been induced to bloom in
  the open air during the summer months. This, however, must only be looked upon as an interesting
  experiment and is not recommended for imitation. <i>O. grande</i> usually flowers in July or
  August, when the season's growth is nearly completed; after this it should be allowed to rest. Mr.
  Fitch's drawing was taken from a handsome variety that flowered last year (1864) in a north house
  at Knypersley, and which had been given me by Mr. Skinner.<a id="NtA_5"

  <p>This brilliant <i>Odontoglossum</i> was first discovered by the late Sir Robert Schomburgk, and
  having been shipped with his other collections from Demerara, has long been supposed to be a
  native of the latter colony. I am, however, satisfied that, beyond the circumstance alluded to,
  there is not the slightest reason for regarding it as a Demerara plant, for no other collector has
  ever found it there, nor would its constitution endure so hot a climate. As Sir Robert, in his
  memorable expedition into the interior of Guiana (1835-37), reached an elevation of 7000 feet, on
  the fourth parallel of latitude, and among the southern affluents of the Orinoco, I have little
  doubt that it was in this region that he discovered <i>O. nævium,</i> along with <i>Maxillaria
  eburnea</i>, <i>Diothonea imbricata</i>, and other treasures that have never yet found their way
  to us in a living state.<a id="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>O. nævium</i> and its varieties appear to be extensively distributed, having been met with
  in many localities, both in Venezuela and New Granada, always, however, at a very considerable
  elevation, and hence the necessity of cool treatment. If this be conceded, the plant is of the
  easiest culture and will flower abundantly in May or June. The figure was taken from a splendid
  specimen in Mr. Rucker's collection.</p>

  <p>I do not think it necessary to adhere any longer to Dr. Lindley's distinction (as noted in the
  'Folia Orchidacea') of a "major" variety, for this is now found to pass insensibly into the
  ordinary type. The former has sometimes been confounded with the <i>O. gloriosum</i> of
  Reichenbach, but this is a perfectly independent form, and as such will shortly be figured in this
  work.</p>

  <p>For the opportunity of figuring this pretty <i>Odontoglossum</i> I am indebted to the kindness
  of the Bishop of Winchester, in whose collection at Farnham Castle it flowered profusely in
  November last. A fortnight afterwards I also received specimens from Mr. Rucker, but the flowers
  of his variety were scarcely so bright in their colouring as those of the Bishop's plant.</p>

  <p><i>O. cariniferum</i>, although now figured for the first time, appears to have been introduced
  several years ago to German collections, and from some of these it has, no doubt, found its way to
  England. It is a native of Central America, where it probably affects a high elevation, as it
  succeeds perfectly under cool treatment, both at Farnham Castle and at West Hill. Its flowers
  continue in perfection for many weeks.</p>

  <p>The name of this plant, associated as it is with the memory of the distinguished botanist who
  has lately passed from among us, is to me suggestive of the most melancholy reflections. Mourn
  indeed I must, the loss of one who had been my steady friend for five-and-thirty years, and by
  whose labours among the members of my favourite tribe, I have been enabled to follow a pursuit
  that has never ceased to be a joy and solace amid all the cares and vicissitudes of life!<a
  id="NtA_7" href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>O. Lindleyanum</i> was so named by Professor Reichenbach, in honour of the great Orchidist
  whose mantle seems now to have fallen upon himself. It is closely allied to the <i>O.
  epidendroides</i> of Humboldt and Kunth, from which indeed Dr. Lindley failed to distinguish it,
  but if the characters of the two species, as represented in the 'Xenia,' prove to be constant, no
  doubt the German Professor was right in separating them.</p>

  <p>Several travellers, including Schlim, Wagener, Warszewicz, and Weir, appear to have met with
  the plant in various localities in New Granada, but always at a great elevation, hence it must of
  course be classed among the coolest section of Orchids. It has flowered in the gardens of the
  Horticultural Society, to which it was sent by their zealous collector Mr. Weir, and also in the
  collection of Mr. Rucker, where Mr. Fitch made his drawing in the spring of last year (1865).</p>

  <p>This remarkable <i>Odontoglossum</i> was long since discovered in New Granada by Schlim and
  Wagener, in whose herbaria its stately many-flowered panicles formed so striking a feature that
  Professor Reichenbach did not hesitate to give the plant the name of <i>gloriosum</i>; an epithet
  which&mdash;now that we have the plant amongst us in a living state&mdash;may perhaps be thought
  to be somewhat beyond its merits. It must indeed be admitted that the fresh blossoms, which are of
  a faint yellowish-green, scarcely realize the expectations which the rich colour and profusion of
  flowers in the dried specimens had very naturally raised. Nor are all the varieties of equal
  merit, some being much smaller and paler than others.</p>

  <p>The species has lately been imported in large quantities, both by Messrs. H. Low and Co., of
  Clapton, and by the Horticultural Society, who received it in 1864 from Mr. Weir, by whom it was
  gathered in the neighbourhood of Bogotá. It flowers freely, and at all seasons of the year; nor
  does it appear to care so much as many of its congeners for a few degrees more or less of heat or
  cold. I believe it has already bloomed in almost every collection of note; though the spikes, as
  was of course to be expected, are as yet far from equal to the wild specimens.<a id="NtA_8"
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> The figure was taken from a plant in Mr. Day's garden, where I
  saw, in November last, nearly a dozen distinct varieties in blow, some of them rivalling the
  example given in the Plate, while others were as insignificant as that which is shown in the
  vignette. The blossoms continue fresh for at least a fortnight, and emit a pleasant honey-like
  scent.</p>

  <p>This pretty species was first described by Professor Reichenbach, from materials derived from
  the collection of Mr. Warner, of Broomfield, in compliment to whom he named it. It also flowered
  with the late Mr. Cauty, of Liverpool, who kindly sent me the specimens from which the figure was
  prepared, but these were smaller and less rich in their colouring than those of Mr. Warner.</p>

  <p>We have no precise information as to the locality where <i>O. Warnerianum</i> grows wild, but
  there can be no doubt that it comes from some part of Mexico, whence we have other species,
  <i>e.g.</i> <i>O. Rossii</i>, <i>O. Ehrenbergii</i>, and <i>O. nebulosum</i>, to all of which it
  is nearly allied. It flowers in the later autumn and winter months, but like most of the other
  members of its section (<i>Leucoglossum</i>), is of a delicate habit, and requires to be very
  carefully handled. It seems to prefer a moderate heat and perhaps a slightly drier atmosphere than
  that in which the New Granada and Peruvian Odontoglossa evidently delight; the compost or
  materials in which the roots grow, should on no account be allowed to become sodden.</p>

    unguis, or claw, is longitudinally callose; and where it expands into the disk, ends in two
    straight pointed and diverging teeth, which, like the claw, are yellow, the rest of the lip
    being white, with or without spots of the same character as those found in the sepals; there are

  <p>This most charming <i>Odontoglossum</i> was discovered in 1863 by Mr. Weir, at an elevation of
  from 7000 to 8000 feet, in the gloomy forests that clothe the slopes of the lofty mountain-ranges
  at the rear of the City of Santa Fé de Bogotá. As the wild specimens of the flowers that he sent
  home to the Horticultural Society indicated not only a new species, but one of surpassing beauty,
  I did not hesitate at once to dedicate it to the illustrious Princess whose name it will
  henceforth bear. Since the first description of the plant appeared in the 'Gardeners' Chronicle'
  many living plants have been received both by the Royal Horticultural Society and by Messrs. Hugh
  Low and Co., of Clapton, several of which have bloomed and, even in their first feeble attempts to
  flower, have more than justified the very high expectations formed of the plant which, as it
  gathers strength, cannot fail to become an established favourite with all Orchid-lovers.</p>

  <p>It proves to be a most variable species, and I am not surprised that my accomplished friend
  Professor Reichenbach should have considered the first examples sent to him from Clapton to differ
  so materially from those of <i>O. Alexandræ</i>, as described by myself, as to justify his
  regarding them as a distinct form, to which, in honour of Messrs. Low's very zealous collector, he
  gave the designation of <i>Bluntii</i>. Since then, however, so many intermediate varieties have
  made their appearance that it is clearly impossible to regard the two supposed species as really
  distinct.</p>

  <p>Specimens of the plant have been sent to me by Messrs. Low, Mr. W. W. Buller, Mr. Rucker, Mr.
  Day, and Mr. Paterson; it has also flowered at Knypersley, but as yet no two specimens have been
  alike for, while some were beautifully spotted on the lip and petals with brown or crimson,
  others, with the exception of the golden crest on the labellum, were of the purest white. To the
  last-named class belonged the specimens grown by Mr. Buller and Mr. Paterson, the latter of which
  were so eminently lovely that they will form the subject of a separate Plate. Mr. Blunt's name may
  very properly be associated with the spotted variety now figured, and which was taken from a plant
  that he sent to his employers at Clapton.</p>

  <p><i>O. Alexandræ</i> is nearly allied to <i>O. crispum</i> and <i>O. Pescatorei</i>; but,
  independently of the structure of its flowers, differs from both in its invariably producing
  simple racemes instead of branched panicles. It flowers freely in the winter and spring months,
  and may apparently be cultivated with the greatest ease. Of course, coming as it does from a great
  elevation, it must not be kept too warm.</p>

  <p>This pretty species is well figured in 'Pescatorea,' where it is stated to be a native of
  Mexico, whence it was introduced by M. Linden, of Brussels. It was from his establishment that I
  derived the plant that is represented on the other side, and which flowered at Knypersley in May
  last (1865). It appears to be very easily managed, requiring the same temperature and treatment as
  <i>O. læve</i>, to which it is nearly allied, and which forms the subject of the following Plate.
  It is also very closely related to <i>O. Karwinskii</i>; and I do not feel certain that the two
  may not eventually have to be united. At present, however, so few plants of either kind exist in
  the collections of this country, that the materials necessary for an extensive comparison are not

  <p>This is not one of the most attractive species, but its stately appearance, the profuseness
  with which its flowers are produced and their pleasant aroma, will secure it a place in most
  collections. It is common in Guatemala, where Mr. Skinner originally discovered it, and it
  probably extends as far as Mexico, where the nearly allied species (<i>O. Reichenheimii</i>),
  figured in the preceding Plate, is found. As it is only met with at a great elevation, it must be
  treated as a very "cool" Orchid, under which <i>régime</i> it will flower abundantly in the spring
  months. The chief danger to be guarded against is that of its exhausting itself&mdash;like many
  species of <i>Phalænopsis</i>&mdash;by over-much flowering, and to prevent which it is of course
  only necessary to break off some of the scapes.</p>

  <p>The vicissitudes which the name of this species has had to undergo within the last three years
  are full of instruction both to botanists and the public. It was first described by Lindley from
  wild specimens gathered by Linden in the neighbourhood of Quindiu. Mr. Weir was the next to meet
  with it, and he succeeded in sending to the Horticultural Society several living plants that had
  been obtained about 100 miles to the south of Bogotá. He also sent wild specimens in admirable
  condition which, not agreeing with Lindley's description, and being profusely furnished both at
  the base of the lip and in the apex of the column with long bristle-like appendages, led to my
  calling it <i>O. hystrix</i> (<i>i. e.</i> the Porcupine Odontoglossum). Messrs. Low also received
  the plant, through their collector Mr. Blunt, from the same locality as that where Weir met with
  it, and one of their plants produced flowers which&mdash;neither agreeing with Lindley's <i>O.
  luteo-purpureum</i> nor with my <i>O. hystrix</i>&mdash;received from Professor Reichenbach the
  name of <i>O. radiatum</i>. Subsequently many specimens flowered, no two of which were alike,
  though they all maintained a sort of distant family resemblance to <i>O. luteo-purpureum</i> of
  which&mdash;as the Professor himself was the first to point out&mdash;there can now be no doubt
  that they are all varieties.</p>

  <p>The figure is taken from a plant that flowered in Mr. Day's collection in the autumn of 1865,
  the flowers of which were twice the size of those of a plant that flowered with me,&mdash;but
  still larger varieties have since appeared in the collections of Lord Egerton of Tatton and Mr.
  Wentworth Buller.</p>

  <p>The species, being found at an elevation of 8000 feet or more, requires very "cool" treatment,
  and should be referred to what&mdash;for reasons stated under Plate XX.&mdash;I propose to call
  the "Peruvian house." In this it is very easily grown, and flowers freely.</p>

  <p>The markings in the dried specimens being much deeper than in the fresh flowers, led Dr.
  Lindley to give it a name (<i>O. luteo-purpureum</i>) which is scarcely applicable to any variety
  that has yet appeared,&mdash;no <i>purple</i> tints having been observed.</p>

  <p>The Plate represents a remarkable state of this now well-known plant, which I have observed
  only in the collection of Mr. Aspinall Turner, of Pendlebury House, near Manchester. In its normal
  or ordinary condition <i>O. Bictoniense</i> produces&mdash;in the winter months&mdash;simple,
  upright flower-stems, but in Mr. Turner's plant the stems are branched, and, what is still more
  extraordinary, are <i>leafy</i> at their extremities! Nor was this peculiarity confined to the
  growth of a single season, for it has already reappeared at least three years in succession! It
  produces a very singular effect, though it can hardly be said to add to the beauty of the
  plant.</p>

  <p><i>O. Bictoniense</i>, so called after Lady Rolle, of Bicton, in Devonshire, was the earliest
  species of this popular genus that ever reached England alive. It also formed a portion of the
  first box of Orchids that I ever received from Guatemala, whence they were sent to me in 1835 by
  my invaluable friend George Ure Skinner, now (1867) alas!&mdash;most suddenly and
  unexpectedly&mdash;numbered with the dead!</p>

  <p>This is not the place for a memoir of that generous and enthusiastic spirit;&mdash;let it
  suffice to state that Mr. Skinner was on his way to Guatemala for a final visit, when he was
  attacked by yellow-fever early in February last on the Isthmus of Panama, and carried off after
  three days' illness! He was collecting plants on the Saturday before his death, and on the
  Wednesday he was a corpse! He was in his 63rd year, and had he but been permitted to return to
  England, would have crossed the Atlantic exactly forty times! He was the discoverer of <i>O.
  grande</i> and <i>O. Uro-Skinneri</i>, already figured in this work, and of at least fifty other
  Orchids, including the well-known <i>Lycaste Skinneri</i> perhaps the most useful and popular of
  its tribe.</p>

  <p>Of this charming Odontoglossum, which I had the honour to dedicate to H.R.H. the Princess of
  Wales, there appear to be innumerable varieties. Of these some&mdash;like the one figured at Plate
  XIV.&mdash;have crimson spots, others again are spotted with brown, while a third
  section&mdash;like the one represented in the Plate&mdash;have flowers of the purest white,
  relieved only by the rich golden crest of the lip. An excellent example of the latter variety was
  sent to me nearly two years ago by Mr. Paterson, of Ashville, Partrickhill, near Glasgow, and from
  this Mr. Fitch's drawing was obtained. Since then, other specimens of the same kind have been
  communicated to me, especially by Mr. Wentworth Buller, Mr. Jones, of Whalley Range, near
  Manchester, Mr. Bull, and Mr. Dawson of Meadow Bank. The last was an admirable specimen bearing as
  it did on a curved stalk about a dozen perfect flowers, all of which faced the same way, so as to
  form a sort of natural tiara exactly suited to a lady's head and which&mdash;especially when worn
  on dark hair&mdash;could not fail to produce a most beautiful effect.</p>

  <p>This variety has also flowered at the Royal Gardens, Kew, a fact that is not a little
  creditable to Mr. Smith's (the Curator's) energy and skill, he being compelled to grow his Orchids
  in houses that are very ill adapted to such a purpose. Surely the Government of this wealthy
  country might afford to devote a few hundred pounds to the construction of houses in which these
  most popular and marvellous plants might be worthily grown!</p>

  <p>As the first specimens of the <i>white</i> variety of <i>O. Alexandræ</i> were collected by Mr.
  Weir, it is only fitting that his name should be associated with it, just as the name of his rival
  Mr. Blunt has been connected with the variety distinguished by its crimson spots. Plants of both
  frequently acquire a reddish tint both in their bulbs and leaves, a tint which, wherever it
  occurs, is a sure criterion by which <i>O. Alexandræ</i> may be distinguished from other
  Odontoglossa that closely resemble it in habit.</p>

  <p><i>O. Alexandræ</i> proves to be a slow grower, and to require the coolest compartment of the
  Peruvian house. If this condition be attended to, it gives no trouble whatever, and produces its
  exceedingly durable flowers very freely indeed.</p>

  <p>Dr. Triana met with it on the trunks of very large trees with dense foliage, ten leagues from
  Bogotá, and also at Pacho.</p>

  <p>This plant is common in many parts of Mexico, especially on the Irapæan mountains in the
  neighbourhood of Valladolid, where it was originally discovered and described by Lexarza, that
  earliest of Orchid-devotees! It was also one of the earliest species of the extensive genus to
  which it belongs that ever produced flowers in England. The credit of introducing it belongs to
  the late Mr. Barker, of Birmingham, with whom it bloomed about the year 1839, but it soon
  disappeared, like nearly the whole of the invaluable collection of Mexican Orchids that I remember
  having seen in the most splendid condition, shortly after their arrival, in his stoves. Fifteen
  years afterwards it was reintroduced by M. Linden, from whose establishment the figure in
  <i>'Pescatorea'</i> was obtained, but it seems to have again been lost. Last spring (1866) I had
  the pleasure of seeing the species in the best possible health in Mr. Dawson's rich and
  admirably-managed collection at Meadow Bank near Glasgow, and from his plant, which flowered in
  April, Mr. Fitch's drawing was prepared. I also received specimens about the same time from Mr.
  Turner. Still more recently, Messrs. Hugh Low and Co. have imported it in large quantities and
  excellent condition, and many good varieties have already appeared, though none that I have yet
  seen are so fine or so richly coloured as that of Mr. Dawson. One that is now flowering at
  Knypersley is a dull yellowish-green.</p>

  <p>In its native country it flowers in March, which is about the time of its flowering with us. As
  to treatment it will naturally be found more at home in the Mexican house, where a cool and
  comparatively dry atmosphere should be maintained, than in the Peruvian house, which should be
  suited to the species that are accustomed to a damper and&mdash;not unfrequently&mdash;still
  cooler climate. I have no doubt that this distinction will be found of much practical utility, for
  although "cool treatment" as opposed to "warm" marks a very important division still, just as
  among "warm" plants it is necessary to separate the East Indian Aerides from the Brazilian
  Cattleyas, so among "cool" plants it will be advisable to separate the Mexican Lælias from the
  Peruvian Odontoglossa. Nay, I apprehend that what I call the "Peruvian house" will itself have to
  be subdivided into two portions, one of which, <i>i. e.</i> the warm portion, will contain such
  plants as the Trichopilias, the Anguloas, and such Odontoglossa as are met with below 6500 feet,
  while the other or cooler portion will be suited to an innumerable multitude of glorious Orchids
  that are met with at a still higher elevation. Already cultivators have discovered that <i>O.
  Phalænopsis</i> and <i>O. nævium</i> cannot be made to thrive in the same house, for though both
  are "cool" plants the former&mdash;coming as it does from a lower level&mdash;requires a decidedly
  warmer climate than the latter, and so it will be in many other cases which are not yet so
  distinctly understood.</p>

  <p>This fine <i>Odontoglossum</i> was one of the earliest known though one of the latest to reach
  us alive. It is now (1873) plentiful enough, and forms a most attractive object in our spring
  Orchid-shows. There are many varieties differing greatly in the size and marking of their flowers,
  but all maintaining the unguiculate sepals and petals which chiefly distinguish it from <i>O.
  luteo-purpureum</i> (Pl. 17), to which it is indeed very nearly allied. <i>O. Hallii</i> is
  abundant in New Grenada and Peru, but is seldom met with at a lower elevation than 8000 feet,
  hence it is quite at home in the coolest part of the "cool Orchid-house," in which it grows and
  flowers very freely indeed.</p>

  <p class="sp5">A charming little species long known by the specimens in the Lindleyan Herbarium.
  It was introduced&mdash;though in very limited quantities&mdash;by the Messrs. Backhouse several
  years ago, since which time it has always continued scarce. In Lindley's Herbarium the racemes are
  about the length of those represented in the figure, but in a specimen exhibited in 1872 by Mr.
  Linden the pseudobulbs, leaves, and racemes were nearly twice as large and as long as those in the
  Plate. The precise treatment that it affects has not yet been distinctly ascertained, but there
  can be no doubt that, being a denizen of high places on the mountain ranges in Peru, it prefers
  the coldest house.</p>

  <p>This is a very fine species indeed, although it scarcely realizes the expectations excited by
  the figure in <i>Pescatorea</i>, whether as regards the size of the individual blossoms or their
  colour. In the fresh flowers the prevailing tone is a bright yellow, which serves as a foil to the
  rich brown or chestnut marking with which the sepals and petals are profusely covered, and which,
  though to a lesser degree, cover also the lip. But in <i>Pescatorea</i> the lip is represented as
  white, and as bearing at its upper extremity a rich blotch of bright purple which affords a
  beautiful contrast to the yellow and brown tints of the other parts of the flower. Probably the
  figure referred to may have been prepared from dried specimens and hence the mistake as to the
  colouring.</p>

  <p>There are many varieties of this species, some of the best of which were exhibited by Mr.
  Marshall of Enfield at a meeting of the Royal Horticultural Society as early as April, 1869.</p>

  <p><i>O. triumphans</i> does not appear to be so plentiful in its native habitats as <i>O.
  Hallii</i>, <i>O. luteo-purpureum</i>, and many other N. Grenada kinds that now swarm in our
  collections. The range of elevation within which it grows is nearly identical with that of <i>O.
  Hallii</i>, hence the same treatment is suitable to both. It is easily grown and flowers
  freely.</p>

  <p class="sp5">This though not a striking is a very distinct plant. It is a native of Costa-Rica,
  where it seems to be plentiful enough though it long eluded detection. It was first exhibited in
  1868 by Mr. Veitch at one of the shows at S. Kensington, but appeared almost simultaneously in the
  collection of Mr. Day, by whose direction a careful drawing was prepared. Like other Costa-Rica
  plants, though not requiring a high temperature, it is scarcely content with the small amount of
  heat that is now allotted to the great majority of cool Orchids. Its proper place would be in the
  Mexican House. It is a free bloomer.</p>

  <p>This is a very distinct species, as remarkable among <i>Odontoglossa</i> with its white and
  purple flowers, as is <i>Oncidium incurvum</i>, with blossoms of similar hues, among the
  innumerable members of that still more extensive genus. Although originally discovered by Colonel
  Hall more than a quarter of a century ago, no genuine plants&mdash;there have been impostors in
  plenty&mdash;seem to have reached Europe alive before the year 1871, when it was introduced by M.
  Linden; by whom also, in the following spring, flowering specimens were exhibited at South
  Kensington and universally admired. According to Lindley, the species is nearly allied to his
  <i>O. ramosissimum</i>, from which, indeed, he at one time failed to distinguish it. M. Linden's
  plant, which is faithfully rendered in Mr. Fitch's drawing, does not exactly answer to the
  descriptions in the Folia Orchidacea either of <i>O. angustatum</i> or <i>O. ramosissimum</i>, but
  is apparently a connecting link between the two, whence I infer the probability that both the
  above supposed species will eventually be found to be one and the same.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The plant is still exceedingly scarce, and as it is indistinguishable in habit from
  many other <i>Odontoglossa</i> derived from the same rich country (Peru), I would warn cultivators
  against purchasing any specimens that have not actually proved themselves to be true. It belongs
  to the cooler sections of its race, and must be treated accordingly.</p>

  <p class="sp5">This species has been long known, but it was slow in making its appearance, and
  slow likewise in flowering after it had reached us. During the last four years both Messrs. Veitch
  and M. Linden have succeeded in importing it alive, but it has only produced flowers in two or
  three instances; the finest specimens I have seen being those exhibited by Lord Londesborough
  during the present spring (1874). Even in its native country it seems to be a shy flowerer. As it
  is never met with lower than 7000 feet on the mountains of Pamplona, it of course requires a
  cooler treatment than many of its congeners which affect a lower level. The shining surface of the
  sepals and petals is very remarkable, and has the appearance of being due to a coat of the best
  varnish. Another species, <i>O. brevifolium</i>, found in lofty mountains in Peru, is closely
  allied to this, if indeed, which I greatly doubt, it be anything more than a very high-level
  variety of it.</p>

  discovered by Mr. Low's collector many years ago. At that time none of the plants reached England
  alive, but some dried specimens that found their way to Professor Reichenbach, enabled the great
  German Orchidist to name and describe the species; which turns out to be nearly allied to <i>O.
  nævium</i>. It has been met with by M. Roezl and other collectors, but is still a rare plant, as
  its constitution is apt to succumb under a long journey by sea and land. The specimens from which
  Mr. Fitch prepared his drawing, flowered in the spring of 1871, in the collection of the Royal
  Horticultural Society;&mdash;the plants having been purchased at one of Stevens' sales, among a
  "miscellaneous lot" of doubtful things. The species is a free-flowerer, and sends out an agreeable
  honey-like odour, but in point of beauty is scarcely a rival for <i>O. nævium</i>. It seems to
  require rather more heat than the latter species, which is one of the coolest of cool Orchids.</p>

  <p>This is the handsomest of known <i>Odontoglossa</i>. In the year 1867 Mr. Low showed me a
  solitary flower, which had been sent to him by his collector (Bowman, I believe), but a discreet
  silence was observed as to the locality where the prodigy had been found, nor, alas, did living
  plants ever make their way to the Clapton Nursery. Subsequently the species was met with by
  Wallis&mdash;when collecting for Mr. Linden&mdash;and later still by Roezl; but although in each
  case a large number of specimens were packed up and despatched to Europe, they either died on the
  passage, or shortly after their arrival. Indeed, cultivators were almost beginning to despair,
  when, early in the spring of last year (1873), the arrival was announced of a small cargo of the
  beauteous novelty in most excellent condition at the establishment of Messrs. Veitch; to whom it
  had been forwarded by Mr. Henry Chesterton. Once safe in the Chelsea collection, it did not put
  the patience of Orchid-growers to any severe strain, for within little more than three months of
  its arrival vigorous flower-spikes were produced, and the plant itself exhibited&mdash;both in
  Regent's Park and at South Kensington&mdash;to the envy and admiration of all beholders. It seems
  to be very easy to manage, and produces its flower-scapes with the utmost profusion. Like all its
  congeners, it must be relegated to the cool Orchid-house, though probably it will be found to
  prefer the warmest end.</p>

  <p>Professor Reichenbach has written several articles in the <i>Gardeners' Chronicle</i> about
  this plant, in one of which he deplores, and most justly, the wanton waste and havoc committed by
  collectors; who, instead of contenting themselves with a moderate number of specimens, gather them
  by hundreds, or even by thousands, thus imperilling the very existence of species which, like the
  present, are believed to possess only a very restricted habitat. Nor does this recklessness often
  benefit their employers, for in most cases, the larger the consignment, the smaller the chance of
  its prospering on its way.</p>

  <p>This is a most charming <i>Odontoglossum</i>, allied to the preceding and to <i>O.
  phalænopsis</i>, but perfectly distinct from either. Its bright green narrow leaves&mdash;streaked
  like those of <i>Saccolabium Blumei</i>, at once distinguish the plant, even when out of flower,
  from its fascinating rival <i>O. vexillarium</i>; which always bears a glaucous hue, and which has
  larger and broader foliage, and produces double the number of flowers on a scape. The first
  rumours that reached us of the plant led to a suspicion that it might, after all, be only a
  variety of <i>O. vexillarium</i>, but these unworthy fears were at once dispelled by the flowering
  of the plant itself at Mr. Bull's nursery in the early part of last September, when Mr. Fitch
  prepared his drawing, and Professor Reichenbach obtained materials for the description which
  appeared in the <i>Gardeners' Chronicle</i> of September 27, 1873. The Professor has also given,
  in his <i>Xenia</i>, a characteristic representation of the wild plant constructed from the
  specimens supplied to him by its fortunate discoverer, Mr. Roezl; in whose honour the species is
  very properly named. It is a native of New Grenada, and, like <i>O. vexillarium</i>, appears to be
  exceedingly rare; we must not, therefore, murmur if the precise locality&mdash;of which the
  knowledge is a fortune in itself&mdash;should be for awhile withheld. But there would have been no
  harm in telling us the approximate elevation of the native habitat, as the same is always
  important as a clue to culture; especially in the case of plants with a limited range. In this
  instance I apprehend that both <i>O. Roezlii</i> and <i>O. vexillarium</i> are not found at a
  <i>very</i> high level and that therefore&mdash;though happily entitled to rank among "cool"
  Orchids&mdash;they must be placed in the warmer division of the "cool" Orchid-house.</p>

  <p>The woodcut represents, for purposes of comparison, two nearly allied <i>Odontoglossa</i>,
  viz., <i>O. pulchellum</i> and <i>O. Egertonianum</i>; they both come from the same country
  (Guatemala) and closely resemble each other in habit&mdash;only that the pseudobulbs of the latter
  have much the sharper edges&mdash;but the flowers are very different. The spikes of <i>O.
  Egertonianum</i> (2) are a sort of Orchid-imitation of the racemes of the "Lily of the Valley,"
  though unfortunately they have no perfume, while those of <i>O. pulchellum</i> (1) emit a
  delicious, almond-like odour, not very unlike that of <i>Gardenia radicans</i>; they are,
  moreover, very chaste and beautiful, and are freely produced during the winter months. Under these
  circumstances the species has long since become, what it well deserved to be, an established
  popular favourite. Yet on its introduction some five-and-thirty years ago&mdash;I had then just
  received the plant from my lamented friend Mr. G. U. Skinner&mdash;its first feeble attempts to
  flower left such an impression of its insignificance upon my mind, that I churlishly refused it a
  place among the magnates of its family in "The Orchidaceæ of Mexico and Guatemala" on which I was
  then engaged! But greater discrimination in the treatment of our plants&mdash;in other words the
  recognition of the system of "Cool-Orchid-growing"&mdash;has led to a more just appreciation of
  its merits.</p>

    <p>The mention of the illustrious traveller's name reminds me of the obligations under which he
    laid me when I first visited Berlin, in the spring of 1836; for, young as I was, he deigned to
    pour into my delighted ears all the stores of Orchid-lore collected during his memorable
    wanderings among the Andes of New Grenada and Peru. Here, he said, the greatest store of
    beauteous Orchids was to be found, and we are now beginning to realize the truth of his
    remark.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="foot">
    <a class="fnote" id="Nt_2" href="#NtA_2">[2]</a>
    <p>Cool Orchids from the interior of South America, have either to be carried across the Andes,
    where the intense cold of the passes is often fatal to them, or to be conveyed by a tedious
    voyage down the great rivers, where the heat is greater than their constitution&mdash;often
    delicate&mdash;can endure. In this way whole importations have been lost, including, I am sorry
    to say, one or two cargoes of the exquisite <i>Odontoglossum Warczewitzii</i> (figured in
    Reichenbach's "Xenia") which still unhappily remains a desideratum.</p>

  <div class="foot">
    <a class="fnote" id="Nt_3" href="#NtA_3">[3]</a>
    <p>As most of the <i>Odontoglossa</i> require to be treated in the same way, I transcribe, from
    the 'Guide to Cool-Orchid Growing' (Reeve, 1864), the following instructions for the culture of
    the genus:&mdash;"They will all succeed perfectly in a low lean-to house facing the north, the
    mean temperature of which need not exceed 60°. They should stand on a shelf of slate or stone,
    near the glass, but should always be protected from the direct rays of the sun. Constant
    humidity should be maintained by damping the shelves and floors, but the plants themselves will
    only require water in moderation, and what is given to them should pass away freely, for if it
    stagnates, or if the compost in which they grow becomes sodden, the roots will immediately
    decay. A gentle evaporation is greatly assisted by placing layers of moss&mdash;to be kept damp
    of course&mdash;on the shelves whereon the plants stand. <i>Odontoglossa</i> cannot endure
    wooden blocks, but will thrive in a compost of which one-half consists of small broken
    potsherds, the remainder being a mixture of shredded sphagnum (dusted with fine sand) and
    fibrous peat. About one-third of the entire depth of the pots may be filled with this mixture,
    the other two-thirds containing nothing but large pieces of broken pots, so as to admit as much
    air as possible to the roots. The pots in which the plants are grown should stand on other pots
    (inverted) placed in saucers of water, in order to secure humidity and protect them from
    wood-lice. Nearly all the species flower during the winter or spring months, a circumstance that
    greatly enhances their value. Many, <i>e. g.</i> <i>O. pulchellum</i>, are deliciously fragrant,
    and the flowers of nearly all the species remain in perfection for weeks, whether left on the
    plants or cut for bouquets. In so vast a genus we shall, no doubt, meet with many
    idiosyncrasies, but nine-tenths of the species will flourish under the treatment indicated
    above, and which may be regarded as suitable to the majority of cool Orchids. Most
    <i>Odontoglossa</i> are, like the <i>Masdevallias</i>, very impatient of the knife, and cannot
    therefore be rapidly multiplied. They have also a peculiar aversion to fumigation by tobacco,
    which causes their leaves to fall off."</p>

  <div class="foot">
    <a class="fnote" id="Nt_4" href="#NtA_4">[4]</a>
    <p>The idea that <i>Cuitlauzina pendula</i> might possibly be identical with <i>Odontoglossum
    citrosmum</i> had more than once occurred to myself, but Lexarza's character of the
    flower-scape,&mdash;which he described as "<i>bracteis destitutus</i>,"&mdash;had always proved
    an insuperable difficulty. It seems, however, that the scapes of the other <i>Odontoglossa</i>
    that he met with happened to be entirely clothed with large inflated bracts; our present plant
    therefore, in which they occur only at long intervals and are exceedingly minute, may in
    comparison be said to be almost "destitute" of them.</p>

    <p>I copy Sir Robert's description of the locality in which these plants were found, in the hope
    that some collector may be induced to visit so interesting a region:&mdash;"The <i>Diothonea</i>
    was met with on the high mountain-chain between the sixty-fifth and sixty-sixth meridian and the
    fourth parallel of latitude, at an elevation of 6-7000 feet above the sea-level. The summits of
    those elevations are thickly covered with two species of Lichen, the white colour of which
    conveys the supposition that the ground is covered with snow. The thermometer stood frequently
    in the morning at 57° F., which, connected with the snow-white Lichens, powerfully reminded us
    of a winter landscape. Indeed, the stunted trees, with grey tortuous branches, would have
    assisted to make the picture complete, if numerous <i>Orchidaceæ</i>, conjointly with green
    Mosses, had not clothed them. Indeed, it was the <i>Orchidaceæ</i> alone that gave the
    vegetation a tropical aspect.... We discovered the <i>Maxillaria</i> near Mount

    <p>It may be well, once for all, to state that in the case of species that have not been long
    imported, and which have therefore not had time to acquire their full strength, the number and
    arrangement of flowers in the figures is taken from native specimens where such are available.
    It sometimes happens that the "wild" standard is never reached in cultivation, but it is more
    frequently exceeded.</p>
